                        <p>
                            My journey into software engineering began during my Computer Science studies at BYU-Idaho, where I discovered my passion for creating solutions that bridge the gap between complex technical challenges and real-world applications. What started as curiosity about how things work has evolved into a career focused on building scalable, impactful software systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects - from developing live translation apps that break down language barriers to architecting innovative data management systems that streamline workflows. Each project has taught me something new and reinforced my belief that technology should serve people, not the other way around.
